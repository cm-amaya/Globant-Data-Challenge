# Setup Guide

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), go there and install it.

From ./src/ you can install all the dependencies with:

```bash
$ uv sync
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment with:

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
